// this method will be used as a shortcut to ease the custom naming convention used across this game
// that is, images targeted for ipad have the ipad_ prefix
// images for iphone don't have such prefix

// standard naming conventions(covered by UIImage imageNamed) state that images for ipad have the ~ipad suffix
// however this game is different and changing it to use the standard would be too complex a task with no clear benefits
